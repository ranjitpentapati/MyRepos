	String details = "&lt;p&gt;Use any Wi-Fi enabled device to get online with Gogo for 30 minutes during this flight.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;table width=&quot;100%&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot;&gt; &lt;tbody&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Your Gogo 30-Minute Pass includes:&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;ul class=&quot;details&quot;&gt; &lt;li&gt;30 minutes of Gogo access on this flight. &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Compatibility with most virtual private network (VPN) software.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Gogo 30-Minute Pass price is specific to this flight. To complete your purchase, you will need to sign in to your Gogo account. If you don&rsquo;t have a Gogo account, you will be prompted to create one. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once you complete your purchase, you are free to connect. If you have a promotional code, you can enter it prior to submitting your credit card information. Taxes may apply, where applicable. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Important notes about the service:&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;ul class=&quot;notes&quot;&gt; &lt;li&gt;A 30-Minute Pass can be purchased at any time while the aircraft is in flight, once the use of electronic devices is permitted. Your pass will expire 30 minutes after your initial login.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;After takeoff, you can use Gogo while the use of electronic devices is permitted by the airline. All policies regarding the use of electronic devices in flight apply. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Gogo is available when your flight is within the continental United States. Service may be interrupted if the aircraft travels outside this area. If/when the aircraft returns to the service area, you can sign back in without making another purchase.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Gogo will become unavailable as the aircraft makes its final approach to its destination and prepares for landing, so please save your work!&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;You will have access to Gogo customer care via eChat live messaging (24 hours-a-day, 7 days-a-week).&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Like any mobile broadband network, speed may vary due to your device, atmospheric conditions, terrain, network capacity, and aircraft location. In order to preserve an equitable passenger experience for everyone, Gogo prioritizes different types of usage. Some content, file sharing or gaming requiring high bandwidth, such as streaming audio and video, is given a lower priority and at times may not work consistently or at all. Your airline may also have policies that would restrict some uses.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt; &lt;/table&gt;";
